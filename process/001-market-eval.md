## Background

As a preliminary step for deploying the Istri intervention in any new geography, a market baseline survey is conducted to understand the current status of the market in terms of awareness and accessibility of the LPG iron box. The share of market operating on Coal and LPG iron boxes is also measured to estimate the potential market size that can be impacted by the intervention.

## Sampling

A population sample of ironing vendors is surveyed to ensure that our survey is an accurate interpretation of the geography.

The sampling method keeps into account the following criteria:
- Covering the geographical spread of the region through administrative boundaries (wards, circles, zones, etc.)
- Population metrics for each of administrative and/or geographical boundaries of the region
- Knowledge about the local geography, market spread, business centres, residential areas, etc.

## Process

The on-ground operations team visits each of the selected geographies selected and collects a sample of size 300, spread equally across all the administrative regions.

The following information is collected about the sample ironing vendors:
- Personal Details
- Business Setup
- Awareness Level
- Product Affordability
- Marketing Preferences

Retailers and distributors in the region are also surveyed to understand their awareness about the new product and the demand they are fulfilling in the region.

## Analysis

The information collected during the survey acts as an indicator towards the potential size of the market and the level of intervention required to enable market transformation in the region.

Following factors are kept in mind while evaluating this decision:
- Market share of various types of iron boxes
- Awareness and affordability of the new product
- Accessibility of the new product in the region
