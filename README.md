# [WIP] The Istri Project
> Increasing productivity & thereby earning power for ironing vendors, by driving conversion to a superior product from their current traditional coal iron boxes.

## Background

### Target Audience

Street side ironing vendors (vyapaaris) who form a significant part of the informal daily wage service sector especially in urban and semi-urban areas.

### The Problem

Working with many ironing vyapaaris closely on the ground, we discovered that one of the key areas they struggled with was their traditional coal iron boxes, the primary asset for their business.
- Heating coal for fuel takes nearly 2 hours everyday
- No temperature control to iron specific clothes
- Coal fillings spill over and even damage the clothes
- Coal has become more costly and less accessible over time
- Health impact of daily exposure to coal emissions

### The Solution

After conducting customer studies with vyapaaris we realized that a good solution for this could be achieved with a simple transition from the coal iron box to an LPG iron box. The LPG iron box had the following benefits:
- Heats up in less than 2 mins
- Temperature can be easily controlled
- Easy access to the fuel 
- No damages to clothes because of coal fillings
- Cost per cloth ironed reduces
- Lesser exposure to emissions
